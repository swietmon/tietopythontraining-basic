### Lesson 4 - Unit testing
- [Testing basics](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/tests/) (focus on *general rules of testing*)
- [Introduction to unittest](http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/articles/introduction-to-unittest.shtml) (sections: *Introduction, Testing, The unittest Module, The assert methods*, skip the rest)
- [py.test unit tests](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/getting-started.html#getstarted) better way to test (it's easier than you think)

### practice projects

1. Write unittest.TestCase tests (2-3) for (The Collatz Sequence) function. 
Define test data for tests in setUp method. 

2. Write test suite with 3 tests for distance function (The length of the segment) using py.test module

3. Test your code from "Adding factorials"(snakify lesson 4) against function from math library.
(optional) try to find case, where your function fails
