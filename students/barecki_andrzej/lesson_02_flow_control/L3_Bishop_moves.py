"""
In chess, the bishop moves diagonally, any number of squares. Given two different squares of the chessboard,
determine whether a bishop can go from the first to the second in one move.

The program receives as input four numbers from 1 to 8,
specifying the column and row numbers of the starting square and the column and row numbers of the ending square.
The program should output YES if a Bishop can go from the first square to the second in one move, or NO otherwise.
