"""
Chess queen moves horizontally, vertically or diagonally
to any number of cells.
Given two different cells of the chessboard, determine whether a queen can go
from the first cell to the second in one move.

The program receives the input of four numbers from 1 to 8,
each specifying the column and row number, first two - for the first cell,
and then the last two - for the second cell.
The program should output YES if a queen can go from the first cell
to the second in one move, or NO otherwise.
