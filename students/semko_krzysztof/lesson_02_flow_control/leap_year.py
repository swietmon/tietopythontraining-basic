"""
Given the year number. You need to check if this year is a leap year.
If it is, print LEAP, otherwise print COMMON.

The rules in Gregorian calendar are as follows:

    a year is a leap year if its number is exactly divisible by 4
    and is not exactly divisible by 100
    a year is always a leap year if its number is exactly divisible by 400

Warning. The words LEAP and COMMON should be printed all caps.

    print("LEAP")
else:
    print("COMMON")
